<h1>Franklin Delta</h1>

<h2>Release status</h2>

<p>Experimental.
<br/>This project is still very new so expect parts to change often. </p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Franklin Delta is based on Johann Rocholl's work on the mini kossel.
<br/>It is named after Rosalind Franklin who contributed to the discovery of the structure of DNA.
<br/>This repository is maintained by Thomas T. SÃ¸rensen.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal is to improve upon the design by Johann Rocholl, especially in these categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Simpler assembly</li>
<li>Better cable management</li>
<li>Fewer parts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wheels instead of rails</li>
<li>Franklin is designed for 3mm filament, rather than 1.75mm used in the kossel</li>
<li>No Z-probe. Franklin uses force sensitive resistors for automatic bed leveling.</li>
</ul>
